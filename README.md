# ACSL-Time-Sheets-with-Swift


[ACSL Time Sheets](https://github.com/Awesomeplayer165/ACSL-Time-Sheets-with-Swift/blob/master/TimeSheets%20(2).doc) is a program designed to calculate the daily pay for each employee.

## Problem:

Most hourly paying jobs require someone to enter information on a time sheet. The ACSL Amusement Park is open from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The Business Office enters a code representing the location where an employee works and the starting time and ending time for each day. The codes entered are as follows:

| Time     | Value |
|----------|-------|
| 9:00 AM  | 1     |
| 9:30 AM  | 2     |
| 10:00 AM | 3     |
| 10:30 AM | 4     |
| 11:00 AM | 5     |
| 11:30 AM | 6     |
| 12:00 PM | 7     |
| 1:00 PM  | 8     |
| 1:30 PM  | 9     |
| 2:00 PM  | A     |
| 2:30 PM  | B     |
| 3:00 PM  | C     |
| 3:30 PM  | D     |
| 4:00 PM  | E     |
| 4:30 PM  | F     |
| 5:00 PM  | G     |
| 5:30 PM  | H     |

## Instructions

- Locations 1-9 get paid $10.00 per hour with no overtime for extra hours.
- Locations 10-19 get paid $8.00 per hour for the first 4 hours and $12.00 for any hours over 4.
- Locations 20-29 get $12.00 per hour for the first 4 hours and double that for any hours over 4.

### Input:

There will be 4 lines of input. Each line will contain 3 characters representing the location, start time
and end time for an employee.
